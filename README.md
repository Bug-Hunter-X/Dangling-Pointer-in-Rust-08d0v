This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating a dangling pointer.  The example uses `as_mut_ptr()` to get a raw pointer to a vector's data and modifies it after the vector goes out of scope. This is unsafe and leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing a crash or data corruption. The solution demonstrates safe alternatives, emphasizing ownership and borrowing for memory management.
